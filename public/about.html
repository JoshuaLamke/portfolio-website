                <p>My name is Joshua Lamke. I am a computer science major at George Mason University.
                    I love learning about new programming languages and frameworks and anything about computer science in general.
                    I find building new things very satisfying especially when they are useful and cool. 
                </p>

            <div id="what-i-do">
                <h3 class="about-header">What I Do</h3>
                <p>The languages that I currently know are Java and Javascript. I also know HTML, CSS, React, and Node.
                    I have created a few websites using Javascript, HTML, and CSS that are available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JoshuaLamke">My Github</a>.
                    I very much enjoy doing frontend work as I have experiance with Javascript, React, and Node but would also love doing backend work as well.
                    If you would like to take a look at some of my projects feel free to check out my github or go to the projects tab to check out a description
                    of the projects I made.

                <h3 class="about-header">What I Am Looking For</h3>
                <p>I am looking for an computer science internship! Frontend or backend work is completely fine
                    as I am willing to learn whatever is needed to complete the tasks I am given. I am very passionate 
                    about computer science and would love to get my foot in the door with a great company that would be 
                    willing to have me!
